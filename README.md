Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, I showcase my projects and expertise in data science. This repository includes detailed descriptions, methodologies, and results of my work.

## **Projects**

### **1. Customer Segmentation**

#### **Overview**
This project focuses on customer segmentation for a personalized marketing approach. The objective is to categorize customers into distinct segments to enable targeted marketing strategies, improving engagement and sales.

#### **Tools & Technologies**
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#### **Steps & Methodology**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilized a dataset containing customer demographics, purchase history, and browsing behavior.
   - Data was gathered from various sources such as customer profiles, transaction logs, and website interactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and normalized the dataset.
   - Handled missing values and outliers using techniques like mean imputation and Z-Score.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA to understand patterns and distributions.
   - Used visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots to identify trends and relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to represent customer behaviors.
   - Used feature scaling techniques such as StandardScaler to normalize data for clustering.

5. **Clustering with K-means**:
   - Applied K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

6. **Cluster Analysis**:
   - Analyzed each cluster to identify unique characteristics and customer behaviors.
   - Segments were defined by attributes such as purchase frequency, average spending, and customer loyalty.

7. **Results**:
   - Identified 4 distinct customer segments: **Frequent Buyers**, **High Spenders**, **New Customers**, and **Inactive Users**.
   - Provided actionable insights to the marketing team for personalized campaigns tailored to each segment.

8. **Visualization**:
   - Created visual representations of clusters using scatter plots and cluster centroids.
   - Visualized the distribution of key metrics within each segment to highlight differences.

9. **Implementation & Impact**:
   - Integrated the customer segments into the company's CRM system.
   - Enabled the marketing team to launch targeted campaigns, leading to a 15% increase in engagement and a 10% boost in sales.

#### **Conclusion**
This project successfully segmented customers into meaningful groups, allowing for effective and personalized marketing strategies. The approach enhanced customer satisfaction and increased revenue by targeting the right audience with relevant offers.
