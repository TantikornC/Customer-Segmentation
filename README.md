# üßë‚Äçüíº Tantikorn Chatavaraha - Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, I showcase my project and expertise in data science. This repository includes detailed descriptions, methodologies, and results of my work when I was an intern at Botnoi Consulting.

## **Project**

### **Customer Segmentation**

#### **Overview**
This project focuses on customer segmentation for a personalized marketing approach. The objective is to categorize customers into distinct segments to enable targeted marketing strategies, improving engagement and sales based on the dataset from a chatbot.

#### **Tools & Technologies**
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#### **Steps & Methodology**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilized a dataset containing customer demographics, purchase history, and browsing behavior.
   - Data was gathered from various sources such as customer profiles, transaction logs, and website interactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and normalized the dataset.
   - Handled missing values and outliers using techniques like mean imputation and Z-Score.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA to understand patterns and distributions.
   - Used visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots to identify trends and relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to represent customer behaviors.
   - Used feature scaling techniques such as StandardScaler to normalize data for clustering.

5. **Clustering with K-means**:
   - Applied K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

6. **Cluster Analysis**:
   - Analyzed each cluster to identify unique characteristics and customer behaviors.
   - Segments were defined by attributes such as purchase frequency, average spending, and customer loyalty.

#### **Analytics & Results**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Data was collected from multiple sources, including MongoDB and Google Sheets, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   - Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling for accurate clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized data distributions using histograms and scatter plots.
   - Identified key patterns such as peak shopping times and popular product categories.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features to capture customer behavior.
   - Additional features such as customer demographics and transaction history were engineered to enhance model performance.

4. **Clustering**:
   - Applied K-means clustering to segment customers into 4 distinct groups: **Frequent Buyers**, **High Spenders**, **New Customers**, and **Inactive Users**.
   - Used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring meaningful segmentation.

5. **Cluster Characteristics**:
   - **Frequent Buyers**: Customers who make frequent purchases, indicating high engagement.
   - **High Spenders**: Customers with high average spending, valuable for premium product targeting.
   - **New Customers**: Recent customers with potential for growth, ideal for introductory offers.
   - **Inactive Users**: Customers with low activity, targeted for re-engagement campaigns.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations such as scatter plots to illustrate the distribution of customer segments.
   - Histograms were used to highlight the distribution of RFM values within each segment.

7. **Impact & Insights**:
   - Implemented targeted marketing strategies based on customer segments, resulting in a 15% increase in customer engagement.
   - Personalized marketing campaigns for high spenders and frequent buyers led to a 10% increase in sales.

8. **Key Findings**:
   - Identified peak shopping hours and days, optimizing marketing efforts for high engagement periods.
   - Discovered that customers in the **High Spenders** segment respond positively to premium offers, driving significant revenue growth.

#### **Visual Analytics**
- **Flow Occurrences**:
